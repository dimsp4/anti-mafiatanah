# Technology Stack — Anti-MafiaTanah

Anti-MafiaTanah leverages **cutting-edge blockchain technology** to revolutionize land certificate management and verification in Indonesia.

## Core Technologies

- **Clarity Smart Contracts (Stacks Blockchain):**  
  All logic for minting, transferring, and verifying land certificate NFTs is written in Clarity, a secure, decidable smart contract language on Stacks. Every land certificate is an NFT, ensuring unique, tamper-proof ownership records.

- **Stacks Blockchain:**  
  Built atop Bitcoin, Stacks provides a secure and decentralized ledger for all certificate transactions. No centralized authority can alter or fake records.

- **Next.js Frontend:**  
  A modern React framework for a fast, interactive, and SEO-friendly user experience. End-users can mint, transfer, and verify certificates seamlessly.

- **@stacks/connect & @stacks/transactions:**  
  These JavaScript libraries let users safely connect their Stacks wallets, sign transactions, and interact with smart contracts from the web UI.

- **Hiro Explorer & API:**  
  Integrated for real-time blockchain data, transaction tracking, and certificate verification.

## Security & Transparency

- **Decentralized Ledger:**  
  Every certificate and ownership change is recorded publicly and immutably.
- **Permissioned Minting:**  
  Only authorized principals (e.g., BPN) can mint new certificates.
- **On-Chain Verification:**  
  Banks, notaries, and the public can verify the authenticity of certificates directly from the blockchain.

## Why This Tech?

- **No more fake certificates** — Blockchain ensures all records are authentic.
- **Traceable ownership** — Every transfer or change is logged and auditable.
- **Open & Trustless** — Anyone can verify ownership without trusting a third party.

Anti-MafiaTanah blends NFT innovation, smart contracts, and user-friendly web tech  
to create a land registry that's secure, transparent, and future-proof.
